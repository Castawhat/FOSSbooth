## More about FOSSbooth
I needed to make (or find) a simple piece of software for a photobooth (A surface tablet and a camera) for my sisters party. I couldnt really find one that suited me so I said "I'll do it myself" and I did! I decided to open source what was orginally Partybooth Web (Now FOSSbooth) to make it modifiable by anyone with a bit of HTML, CSS and JS.
